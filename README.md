During my first year on the IUT from Haguenau I did two main project:

- I reproduce the homepage of Netflix : https://tp2.iha.unistra.fr/~timmel/Netflix/Netflix.php
  For this project I used basic HTML, CSS and PHP.

- My second project was to create where a user can get an opinion about a movie : https://tp2.iha.unistra.fr/~timmel/SAE203/index.php
  I used again HTML, CSS for the front end and PHP and twig for the CSS.
